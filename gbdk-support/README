gbdk3-2.91 - http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/
----------------------------------------
This is a early-release beta.  Please report any bugs :)

Reporting problems and feature requests
---------------------------------------
1.  Make sure that you have read this README fully.
2.  Read the latest copy of this README
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/gbdk-support/README?cvsroot=gbdk
3.  Make sure you have the latest version
    https://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=1249
4.  Check if anyone else has reported the problem
    https://sourceforge.net/bugs/?group_id=1249
5.  Submit a new bug using the link above.  It is _very_ helpful if you can 
    show how to reproduce the bug and/or give me the source to try and/or
    use the --dumpall (lcc -Wf--dumpall) option and send me all of the *.dump
    files.  Use the email address below.

To download the latest source, get the tarball on sourceforge,
extract, and type:

make -f update.mak update

The Linux binary needs to be installed in /usr/lib/gbdk, and
the win32 binary in the root directory of some drive.  This will
change.  Linux users also need to install libgc4 or above (Debian
users try 'apt-get install libgc5').  The win32 version is compiled
with cygwin b20.

Differences between this and gbdk-2.1.5
---------------------------------------
* It now uses sdcc <http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/> as the C compiler
  which should lead to better code but unfortunatly will generate
  a whole new set of bugs :)  Most of the differences below are due
  to this change-over.
* sdcc _does not_ automatically promote varibles to int's.  This is 
  a 'good thing' as normally the promotion is unwanted on an eight
  bit system, but in some places you may get the wrong result.  If
  so, try promoting the varible manually i.e. (int)foo*20;
* The basic types have changed.  The sizes are now:
	char		8 bits
	int		16 bits
	long		32 bits
	long long	Doesnt exist
* Float support is there but unconnected.
* gbdk changes the basic typedefs to make it more normal.  You can
  define GBDK_2_COMPAT=1 (lcc -DGBDK_2_COMPAT=1 ...) to use the old
  typedefs.
	Before		Now		Or		Size
	BYTE		INT8				8 signed
	UBYTE		BYTE		UINT8		8 unsigned
	WORD		INT16				16 signed
	UWORD		WORD		UINT16		16 unsigned
	DWORD		INT32				32 signed
	UDWORD		DWORD		UINT32		32 unsigned
* There is now real initalised static data support.  You can now use
  BYTE abModifyMeLater[] = { 5, 6, 7, 8 };

  void foo(void) 
  {
    abModifyMeLater[2] = 12;
  }
  and it will work.  Currently this is very inefficent but it will
  be improved.  See const in the next section
* Constant global structs (ie tile data, sprites) SHOULD be declared
  as 'const'  If they are not declared const, not only do they get copied
  into ram at startup but they take up about 6x the rom space.

Notes
-----
The galaxy.c example compiles with errors.  This is expected.
