Gameboy and more.

A very quick overview
---------------------

The GBDK is based around the lcc retargetable C compiler with
a gbz80 backend, the ASxxxx assembler and linker, and a set of libraries.

The gbz80 is very similar to the Zilog Z80, and from 2.0.16 it has been
possible to target GBDK to a real Z80.  See 'Compiling' later for more
information.

Targets
-------
Processors:
	gbz80 (as used in the Gameboy)
	z80 (as in the Gamegear and pretty much every home computer
	     from the 1980's)
Platforms:
	gb (Nintendo Gameboy)
	gg (Sega Gamegear - very limited support)

Host platforms
--------------
DOS - has been compiled with gcc-go32 and mingw32.
Unix - Developed under Solaris and Linux-glibc.

Building
--------
All options are set through the Makefile.  I (MLH) reccomend using command
line options instead of modifing the Makefile.  Defaults have an asterix
beside them.

TARGETOS (host operating system - used for cross-compiling)
	unix (*)
	dos
	See also HOSTCC and HOSTLD if cross-compiling

PLATFORM
	gb (*) - Nintendo GB/CGB/SGB
	rrgb - Rough 'n ready Gameboy emulator 
	     - see www.pcmedia.co.nz/~michaelh/
	gg - Sega Gamegear (incomplete)
	z80 - generic z80

PROCESSOR 
	gbz80 (*)
	z80 

SDK_DIR - top level of where GBDK will be installed.
	Default is $(HOME) - installs into $(HOME)/SDK/...
	Alternative - /usr/lib to install into /usr/lib/SDK/...

'make' build it
'make install' installs it on a Unix system
'make dist' makes the distribution
'make zdist' makes a compressed distribution
'make clean' does something.

e.g
'make SDK_DIR=/usr/lib PLATFORM=rrgb install'
