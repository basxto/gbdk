    <h1>Guidelines and Troubleshooting: GBDK</h1>
<!-- ############################################################ -->
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Guidelines"></A>GBDK Programming Guidelines</H2>

<UL>
	<LI>Use 8-bit values as much as possible.
	<LI><B>Prefer unsigned variables to signed ones.</B> The code generated will be generally more efficient, espacially when comparing two values.
	<LI>Using global variables is generally more efficient that using local variables. In particular, <B>avoid big local variables</B> (such as arrays or structures). The code could be inefficient if you have more than 127 bytes of local variables.
	<LI>The lcc compiler does not fold every possible constant expression. For instance, in the following code:
<PRE>
    foo(i + 2 - 1);
</PRE>
	lcc will add 2 and substract 1, instead of just adding 1. In this situation, you should parenthesize then constant expression:
<PRE>
    foo(i + (2 - 1));
</PRE>

	<LI>Try to use only the following type definitions for integer variables (defined in <CODE>type.h</CODE>):
<PRE>
    BYTE
    UBYTE
    WORD
    UWORD
    LWORD
    ULWORD
</PRE>
	or
<PRE>
    INT8
    UINT8
    INT16
    UINT16
    INT32
    UINT32
</PRE>
	That way, you will always know the size of your variables.
	<LI>When using constants, use the <CODE>U</CODE>, <CODE>L</CODE> and <CODE>UL</CODE> postfixes when necessary. <CODE>U</CODE> specifies that the constant is unsigned, while <CODE>L</CODE> specifies that the constant is long. Consider the following example:
<PRE>
    UBYTE i, j = 0;
    i = j+0x80;
</PRE>
	The compiler will think that <CODE>0x80</CODE> is a signed value, and since it is bigger than the biggest signed 8-bit value (0x79), the compiler will treat it as a long constant. Following the C specification, <CODE>j</CODE> will be extended to a long, and added to <CODE>0x80</CODE> using a long addition (which is costly on an 8-bit processor), before beeing truncated to an 8-bit value and assigned to <CODE>i</CODE>. This example should be written:
<PRE>
    UBYTE i, j = 0;
    i = j+0x80U;
</PRE>
	<LI>Avoid using multiplications, divisions and modulos as much as possible. These operations have no corresponding CPU instructions (software functions), and hence are time costly.
	<LI>Do not declare initialized variables at the file level, except when they are read-only, because they will be located in ROM, e.g. 
<PRE>
    int i1;          /* OK    : will be located in RAM */
    char *s1;        /* OK    : will be located in RAM */
    int i2 = 0;      /* Error : will be located in ROM */
    char *s2 = &quot;Hi&quot;; /* Error : will be located in ROM */

    void main() { ... }
</PRE>
	<LI>Prefer the <CODE>==</CODE> and <CODE>!=</CODE> comparison operators to <CODE>&lt;</CODE>, <CODE>&lt;=</CODE>, <CODE>&gt;</CODE>, and <CODE>&gt;=</CODE>. The code will be shorter and quicker. For instance:
<PRE>
    for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
</PRE>
   is less efficient than
<PRE>
    for(i = 0; i != 10; i++)
</PRE>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Porting"></A>Porting Code from GBDK 1.1 to GBDK 2.0</H2>

<UL>
	<LI>Change your <CODE>int</CODE> variables to <CODE>long</CODE> if they have to be bigger than 255. If they should only contain values between 0 and 255, use an <CODE>unsigned int</CODE>.
	<LI>If your application uses the <CODE>delay</CODE> function, you'll have to adapt your delay values.
	<LI>Several functions have new names. In particular some of them have been changed to macros (e.g. <CODE>show_bkg()</CODE> is now <CODE>SHOW_BKG</CODE>).
	<LI>You will probably have to change the name of the header files that you include.
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="Mixing"></A>Mixing C and Assembly</H2>

<P>
For mixing C and assembly, you must use one file per language (you cannot embed C code with assembly) and link both files together. Here are the things to know:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>A C identifier <CODE>i</CODE> will be called <CODE>_i</CODE> in assembly.
	<LI>Results are always returned into the <CODE>DE</CODE> register.
	<LI>Parameters are always passed on the stack (starting at <CODE>SP+2</CODE> because the return address is also saved on the stack).
	<LI>Assembly identifier are exported using the <CODE>.globl</CODE> directive.
	<LI>You can access GameBoy hardware registers using <CODE>_reg_0xXX</CODE> where <CODE>XX</CODE> is the register number (see <CODE>sound.c</CODE> for an example).
	<LI>Registers must be preserved across function calls (you must store them at function begin, and restore them at the end), except <CODE>HL</CODE> (and <CODE>DE</CODE> when the function returns a result).
</UL>

<P>
Here is an example of how to mix assembly with C:
</P>

<h2><CODE>main.c</CODE></h2>

<PRE>
    main()
    {
      WORD i;
      WORD add(WORD, WORD);

      i = add(1, 3);
    }
</PRE>

<h2><CODE>add.s</CODE></h2>

<PRE>
    .globl _add
    _add:         ; WORD add(WORD a, WORD b)
                  ; There is no register to save:
                  ;  BC is not used
                  ;  DE is the return register
                  ;  HL needs never to be saved
    LDA  HL,2(SP)
    LD   E,(HL)   ; Get a in DE
    INC  HL
    LD   D,(HL)
    INC  HL
    LD   A,(HL)   ; Get b in HL
    INC  HL
    LD   H,(HL)
    LD   L,A
    ADD  HL,DE    ; Add DE to HL
    LD   D,H
    LD   E,L
                  ; There is no register to restore
    RET           ; Return result in DE
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="Multiple"></A>Multiple Bank Images</H2>

<P>
GBDK can generate multiple bank images (with both multible ROM and RAM banks) for MBC1 and MBC2 memory bank controllers. Multiple RAM banks are only supported by MBC 1.
</P>

<P>
With multiple ROM banks, addresses 0x0000 to 0x3FFF are reserved for the fixed ROM bank, while addresses 0x4000 to 0x7FFF are switchable, i.e. can be used for any bank. Switchable ROM banks are called <CODE>_CODE_1</CODE>, <CODE>_CODE_2</CODE>,... and the fixed ROM bank is called <CODE>_CODE</CODE> (note that there is no <CODE>_CODE_0</CODE>). The maximum number of ROM banks is 32.
</P>

<P>
Addresses 0xC000 to 0xDFFF are always reserved for the internal RAM. Addresses 0xA000 to 0xBFFF are reserved for (switchable) external RAM. External RAM banks are called <CODE>_BSS_0</CODE>, <CODE>_BSS_1</CODE>, <CODE>_BSS_2</CODE>,... and internal RAM is called <CODE>_BSS</CODE>. The maximum number of external RAM banks is 4.
</P>

<P>
When deciding how to populate your RAM banks, remember that local variables are always allocated on the stack, and initialized global variables are located in ROM. Only uninitialized global or static variables are allocated into RAM.
</P>

<P>
For generating multiple bank images, you have to:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Place the code for your ROM bank in one or several source files. All the code of the source file(s) will be in the same ROM bank.
	<LI>Compile the source file into an object file, and specify in which ROM bank to locate the code using the <CODE>-Wf-bo#</CODE> flag (where <CODE>#</CODE> is the number of the bank, greater than 0). If you do not use this flag, the code will be located in the fixed ROM bank.
	<LI>Place the code for your RAM bank in one or several source files. All the data of the source file(s) will be in the same RAM bank.
	<LI>Compile the source file into an object file, and specify in which RAM bank to locate the code using the <CODE>-Wf-ba#</CODE> flag (where <CODE>#</CODE> is the number of the bank, greater or equal to 0). If you do not use this flag, the data will be located in the internal RAM.
	<LI>Repeat this for all your banks. You can also use both flags on the same file to locate code and data in different ROM and RAM banks.
	<LI>Link the object files, and specify the number of banks using the <CODE>-Wl-yo#</CODE> (for ROM) and <CODE>-Wl-ya#</CODE> (for RAM) flags (where <CODE>#</CODE> is the number of banks), and the type of MBC used in the cartridge using the <CODE>-Wl-yt#</CODE> flag (where <CODE>#</CODE> is the cartridge type code to be located at address 0x147 of the image).<BR>
	Standard supported ROM sizes are:
<PRE>
  256Kbit =  32KByte =   2 banks
  512Kbit =  64KByte =   4 banks
    1Mbit = 128KByte =   8 banks
    2Mbit = 256KByte =  16 banks
    4Mbit = 512KByte =  32 banks
</PRE>
	Standard supported RAM sizes are:	
<PRE>
     None
   64kBit =  8kB = 1 bank
  256kBit = 32kB = 4 banks
</PRE>
	Standard supported cartridge types are:
<PRE>
  0 : ROM ONLY
  1 : ROM+MBC1
  2 : ROM+MBC1+RAM
  3 : ROM+MBC1+RAM+BATTERY
  5 : ROM+MBC2
  6 : ROM+MBC2+BATTERY
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>
Bank switching is not automatic in programs. You have to explicitely call the <CODE>switch_rom_bank()</CODE> and <CODE>switch_ram_bank()</CODE> functions. See <CODE>banks.c</CODE> for a complete example.
</P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="RAM"></A>Copying Functions to RAM and HIRAM</H2>

<P>
It is possible to copy functions to RAM and HIRAM (using the <CODE>memcpy()</CODE> and <CODE>hiramcpy()</CODE> functions), and execute them from C. The compiler automatically generates two symbol for the start and the end of each function, named <CODE>start_X</CODE> and <CODE>end_X</CODE> (where <CODE>X</CODE> is the name of the function). This enables to calculate the length of a function when copying it to RAM. Ensure you have enough free space in RAM or HIRAM for copying a function.
</P>

<P>
There are basically two ways for calling a function located in RAM, HIRAM, or ROM:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Declare a pointer-to-function variable, and affect it the address of the function to call.
	<LI>Declare the function as <CODE>extern</CODE>, and set its address at link time using the <CODE>-Wl-gXXX=#</CODE> flag (where <CODE>XXX</CODE> is the name of the function, and <CODE>#</CODE> is its address).
</UL>

<P>
The second approach is slightly more efficient. Both approaches are illustrated in the <CODE>ram_fn.c</CODE> example.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="Interrupt"></A>Interrupt Handlers</H2>

<P>
The GameBoy hardware can generate 5 types of interrupts:
</P>
<PRE>
  VBL : V-blank
  LCD : LCDC status
  TIM : Timer overflow
  SIO : Serial I/O transfer end
  JOY : Transition from high to low of joypad
</PRE>

<P>
It is possible to install your own interrupt handlers (in C or in assembly) for any of these interrupts. Up to 7 interrupt handlers can be installed for each interrupt. Interrupt handlers are called in sequence. To install a new interrupt handler, do the following:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Write a function (say <CODE>foo()</CODE>) that takes no parameter, and that returns nothing. Remember that the code executed in an interrupt handler must be short.
	<LI>Install you interrupt handling routines using the <CODE>add_XXX()</CODE> function, where <CODE>XXX</CODE> is the interrupt that you want to handle.
	<LI>Enable interrupts for the IRQ you want to handle, using the <CODE>set_interrupts()</CODE> function. Note that the VBL interrupt is already enabled before the <CODE>main()</CODE> function is called. If you want to set the interrupts before <CODE>main()</CODE> is called, you must install an initialization routine.
</UL>

<P>
See <CODE>irq.c</CODE> for a complete example.
</P>

<!-- ############################################################ -->
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Initialization"></A>Initialization Routine</H2>

<P>
You can install a routine that will be executed before the <CODE>main()</CODE> function is called, and just before the interrupts are enabled. For instance, you can use an initialization routine to modify the interrupt flags and avoid that a VBL IRQ is handled before <CODE>main()</CODE> is executed. For installing an initialization routine, you have to:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Write a function (say <CODE>foo()</CODE>) that takes no parameter, and that returns nothing.
	<LI>At link time, specify the name of the initialization routine using the <CODE>-Wl-g.init=XXX</CODE> flag (where <CODE>XXX</CODE> is the name of your function). Remember that your function will have an initial underscore in assembly. In our example, it will be <CODE>-Wl-g.init=_foo</CODE>.
</UL>

<!-- ############################################################ -->
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Changing"></A>Changing Important Addresses</H2>

<P>
It is possible to change the addresses of some important data at link time using the <CODE>-Wl-gXXX=YYY</CODE> flag (where <CODE>XXX</CODE> is the name of the data, and <CODE>YYY</CODE> is the new address). The addresses that can be changed are:
</P>
<PRE>
  .OAM         : Location of sprite ram (requires 0xA0 bytes)
  .STACK       : Initial stack address
  .refresh_OAM : Address to which the routine for refreshing OAM will be copied (must be in HIRAM)
  .init        : Initialization routine
</PRE>
