At the moment, it is sold in Japan only. Here is a description written by Damon Barwin (Kingpin), its developer:</P><CITE><P>Action Replay is a cheat device for the Nintendo GameBoy.</P><P>This is the second version of AR for the GameBoy, the original released many years ago would not work with games that included external ram (extra memory found in the gamepak).</P><P>The device plugs into the cartridge port of the GameBoy. It is in the shape on a standard gamepak with an external connector for the user to plug a game into.</P><P>Cheats can be found using an inbuilt trainer or can be simply typed in from a extensive library found on the internet.</P><P>You can use up to twentyfive cheats at the same time, these could be used enabling you to change the number of lives, amount of energy, current level or anyother thing you could think of to change that uses the memory for its attributes. Once these cheats have been activated they appear to the system every time the GameBoy refreshes the screen, this allows it to function with almost every game.</P><P>The trainer includes its own 128k of ram, this is three times the maximum gameboy ram. Training could not be easier.</P><P>This is all assisted with full on screen menus and graphics.</P><P>Action Replay was developed using the very powerful GBDK (GameBoy Development Kit) by Pascal Felber.</P></CITE><CENTER><P><IMG ALT="[Pro Action Replay II]" SRC="ProAR2_1.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="144" BORDER="1"><IMG ALT="[Pro Action Replay II]" SRC="ProAR2_2.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="144" BORDER="1"><IMG ALT="[Pro Action Replay II]" SRC="ProAR2_3.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="144" BORDER="1"></P></CENTER><!-- ############################################################ --><P><A HREF="index.html">Back</A></P><!-- #include "PF footer.incl" --><HR>Last Updated 7-Jan-98, <A HREF="mailto:felber@di.epfl.ch">Pascal Felber</A><!-- end include --></BODY></HTML>
