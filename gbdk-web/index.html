<b>7th May - 2.94 released.</b>  Many fixes - see the README for more.
<p>
<b>7th May - Library documentation up.</b>  A good size part of the libraries that go with gbdk have been documented - follow the HTML link above to have a look.  Thanks
to <a href="http://quangdx.com/">quang</a> for a good chunk of the <tt>gb.h</tt> documentation.  Please report any errors :)
<p>
<b>6th April - 2.93 released.</b>
From the README
<ul>
<li>Added multi-bank support into the compiler
   - The old -Wf-boxx and -Wf-baxx options now work
</li>
<li>Has preliminary support for generating rgbds and ISAS compatible
  assembler.  Try -W--asm=rgbds or -W--asm=isas.  The ISAS code is
  untested as I dont have access to the real assembler.
</li>
<li>RSH is fixed
</li>
<li>AND is fixed
</li>
<li>The missing parts of 2.1.0's libs are there.  Note: They are untested.
</li>
<li>The dscan demo now fully works (with a hack :)
</li>
<li>There is a bug with cached computed values which are later used as pointers.
  When the value is first used as a BYTE arg, then later as a pointer
  the pointer fails as the high byte was never computed and is now missing.
  A temporary fix is to declare something appropriate as 'volatile' to
  stop the value being cached.  See dscan.c/bombs() for an example.
</li>
</ul>
<b>26th March - 2.92-2 for win32 available</b>.
This is a maintenance release for win32 which fixes some of the niggly
install problems, especially:
<ul>
<li>WORDS are now back to signed.  <tt>GBDK_2_COMPAT</tt> is no longer needed.</li>
<li>Temporary files are created in TMP, TEMP, or TMPDIR instead of c:\tmp</li>
<li>The installer is no more as it's not needed.  There is a WinZip
wrapped version for those with the extra bandwidth :).</li>
<li>gbdk autodetects where it is installed - no more environment varibles.</li>
<li>cygwin1.dll and make are no longer required - gbdk is now compiled with mingw32.</li>
</ul>
See the ChangeLog section in the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/gbdk-support/README?cvsroot=gbdk">README</a> for more information.
<p>
<b>21st March - Problems with the installer</b>.  It seems that the demo of
InstallVISE has an unreasonably short time limit.  I
had planed to use the demo until the license key came through, but theres
no sign of the key yet and the 3 day evaluation is up.  If anyone
knows of a free Windows installer with the ability to modify environment
varibles, please <a href="mailto:michaelh@earthling.net">contact me</a>.
I hear that temporarily setting you clock back to the 15th works...
<p>
<b>18th March - libc5 version available / "Error creating temp file"</b>
Thanks to Rodrigo Couto there is now a Linux/libc5 version of gbdk3-2.92
available - follow the download link above.  At least it will be there when
the main sourceforge site comes back up...  Also some people have reported a bug where the compiler reports '*** Error creating temp file'.  Try typing <tt>"mkdir c:\tmp"</tt> from a DOS prompt and see if that helps.
<p>
<b>8th March - gbdk3 2.92 released.</b>
Better than 2.91 :).  Can now be installed anywhere.  All the demos work.
See the README for more.
<p>
<b>27th Feb - gbdk3 2.91 released.</b>
Better than 2.90 and includes Linux, win32 and a source tar ball.  Some notes:
<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/gbdk-support/README?cvsroot=gbdk">README</a> <b>first</b></li>
<li>Linux users need libgc-4 or above.  Debian users try <tt>apt-get install libgc5</tt>.</li>
<li>All the types have changed.  Again, please read the README first.</li>
<li>I prefer release early, release often.  The idea is to get the bugs out there so that they can be squashed quickly.</li>
<li>I've split up the libs so that they can be used on other platforms and so that the libs
can be updated without updating the compiler.  One side effect is that gb specific files
have been shifted into their own directory i.e. <tt>gb.h</tt> is now <tt>gb/gb.h</tt>.</li>
</ul>
		      Many of the other pages on this site are now out of date.  And gbdk3 needs a logo...  I have seen trouble with the examples and no$gmb.
<p>
			<b>23rd Feb First release of gbdk/sdcc</b>.
This is an early release - the only binary is for Linux and the source is only available through cvs.  If your interested in the source, have a look at
the cvs repository <tt>gbdk-support</tt> first, which will download all the
rest of the code.  Alternativly, look at <tt>gbdk-support</tt> and <tt>gbdk-lib</tt> at <tt>cvs.gbdk.sourceforge.net</tt> and <tt>sdcc</tt> at
<tt>cvs.sdcc.sourceforge.net</tt>.  I will be working on binaries for Win32 and a source tar ball soon.  Please report any bugs through the <tt>bugs</tt> link above.
<p>
			<b>31st Jan Added Dermot's <a href="dgbfar.html">far pointer spec</a>.</b>
It's mainly here for comment.  If <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">sdcc</a> is ported to the Gameboy then I
will be looking for some way to do far calls.
<p>
			<b>8th Jan Moved over to <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">sourceforge.net</a></b>.  Thanks must go to David Pfeffer for gbdk's previous resting place, www.gbdev.org.  The transition is not complete, but cvs and web have been shifted.
			Note that the cvs download instructions are stale - you should now look to cvs.gbdk.sourceforge.net.
			<br>
			I am currently working on porting sdcc over to the Z80.  David Nathan is looking at porting it to the GB.
			<p>
			<b>6th Jan</b> <a href="http://www.gbdev.org/news/">Icehawk</a> wrote <i>"I did write some rumble pack
			  routines. Just make sure to remind people to add -Wl-yt0x1C or -Wl-yt0x1D
			  or -Wl-yt0x1E depending on sram and battery usage. Find the routines on my
			  site (as usual). =)"</i>
		      <p>
			<B>18th Oct - Bug tracking / FAQ up</b>.  Try the link on the left to report any bugs with GBDK.  It's also the first place to look if your having problems.<p>
			<B>17th Oct - GBDK 2.1.5 is available</b>.  The compiler is the same, but some of the libraries have been improved.  memset() and memcpy() are much faster, malloc() is fixed, and a high speed fixed block alternative malloc() was added.<p>
			    The most common question I get asked is along the lines of 'I tried to compile <i>xxxx</i> but I get an error saying 'crt0.o' not found.  crt0.o is the compiled form of crt0.s in the <tt>lib</tt> directory - <tt>cd</tt> to <tt>lib</tt> and type <tt>'make'</tt> to compile it and the rest of the library files,
		      <p>
			The source to a 
			<a href="ftp://gbdk.sourceforge.net/pub/gbdk/remocon19990627.zip">universial remote control for the CGB</a> from Mr.K.I. and Mr.N.U of TeamKNOx is now available.
			<p>
			TeamKNOX can be found <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~TeamKNOX">here.</a>  They have an impressive PDA written partly in GBDK.
		      <p>
			Thanks to E. Allen Soard there is now a precompiled binary for <a href="http://www.linux.com/">Linux</a>
			with libc5.
		      <p>
			A <b>preliminary</b> version
			    of the libraries documentation is available
			    <a href="doc/html/book01.html">online</a>
			    or in <a href="doc/gbdk-doc.pdf">PDF form</a>  It has not been updated to reflect gbdk3.
		      <p>
			For technical information on
			the GameBoy hardware, see <a href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~jfrohwei/gameboy/home.html">here</a>.
		      <p>Have a look at
			    the <a href="http://www.tripmode.com/gbdev/">GBDoK</a> documentation
			    page maintained by Jason.
		      <p>GBDK 2.1.0 was Pascal's last
			    personal release. These web pages are now maintained by Michael Hope.
		      <p>So, whats the future of GBDK?
			    You tell <a href="mailto:michaelh@earthling.net">me</a> :) Some ideas are
			    Style suggestions (<a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a> compatible)
			    would be appreciated.
		      <p>I'm interested in any libraries
			    that people may have written for GBDK - please contact me directly.&nbsp;
		      <h2>
			<a NAME="Highlights"></a>Highlights</h2>
		      The GameBoy Developer's Kit
			  (GBDK), is a set of tools that enable to develop programs for the Nintendo
			  GameBoy system, either in C or in assembly. GBDK includes a set of libraries
			  for the most common requirements and generates image files for use with
			  a real GameBoy or with an emulator like <a href="http://www.komkon.org/fms/VGB/">VGB</a>
			  or <a href="http://www.work.de/nocash/">no$gmb</a>.
		      <p>GBDK is available for UNIX
			    and DOS. The UNIX version of GBDK has been tested on Debian Linux 2.1. The Win32 version runs from inside a win32 DOS box - note that it may be possible to recompile so that it will also work
			under DPMI.
		      <p>GBDK features:
		      <ul>
			<li>
			  An ANSI C compiler.</li>

			<li>
			  An assembler that generates
			      relocatable code.</li>

			<li>
			  A peephole optimizer.</li>

			<li>
			  A linker that produces GameBoy
			      image files.</li>

			<li>
			  Support for multiple-bank images.</li>

			<li>
			  Smart linking.</li>

			<li>
			  A set of libraries, with source
			      code.</li>

			<li>
			  Example programs in assembly
			      and in C.</li>
		      </ul>
		      <a href="http://www.aracnet.com/~pfelber/GBsed/">GBsed</a>,
			  a companion sprite editor written in Java, enables to create images and
			  sprites to be included in GameBoy programs. Alternatively, you can use
			  the Win 95/NT BMP2GB program by <a href="mailto:Ian@resourcekt.co.uk">Ian
			    James</a> that convert BMP files to C code, or the Win 95/NT <a href="http://www.casema.net/~hpmulder/">GameBoy
			    Tile Designer and Map Builder</a> programs that lets you create images
			  and maps for GBDK.
		      <h2>
			<a NAME="Status"></a>Status</h2>
		      GBDK is freeware for non-commercial
		      developments. Most of the code is under the GPL.  The runtime libraries should be under the LGPL.  The non-commercial clause is from the C front end, lcc.  If you use it, please send me an e-mail to keep me informed
		      of your work. If you really find it great, you can send me something typical
		      from your country...
		      <p>If GBDK is used for developing
			a commercial program, I ask you to mention that the program has been made
			using GBDK (in the credits), and to send me a copy of the finished product.
			If you feel generous, you can also send me a copy of any other products
			that your company has produced for the GameBoy...
